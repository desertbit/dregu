# DREGU - Docker REGistry Utility
This tool is a simple wrapper around the official Go bindings of the [docker-registry client](github.com/desertbit/docker-registry-client/registry)  
Currently, a simple list command is supported, to print out which Images/Tags the registry contains.

For more details, see `dregu -h`
